                <h3>Distinction in Playing the Keyboard</h3>
                <p class="details">
                    I find pleasure in playing the keyboard during my leisure time. The harmonious tunes of recognizable songs and natural flow of the hand movements to the rhythm calms me down and has a soothing effect. I enjoy playing Hindi songs on the keyboard and singing along during my leisure time. It helps me unwind and breaks the monotony of the day. Under the guidance of my teacher Mr. Jaspal Singh, I have played the keyboard at various social events. I have been awarded a level 1 degree for my skills by Pracheen Kala Kendra. I achieved the first division in keyboard classical and got a distinction in the practical.
