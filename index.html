                    Hi there! I’m Daksh Verma, a curious and driven computer science enthusiast currently studying at the National Institute of Technology Delhi (NIT Delhi). I’ve always had a knack for solving problems, and what excites me the most is the ability to take complex challenges and break them down into something tangible through technology. Whether it's writing code or creating innovative solutions, I thrive on diving deep into the intricacies of programming and tech.
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>
                    I find joy in the creative side of tech—building projects that push boundaries. Whether it’s a cool gadget powered by IoT or an AI-driven model, I’m always looking for ways to innovate. My academic journey has been full of moments that sparked my passion even further, like securing top ranks in national competitions or developing projects that combine my love for mathematics and computing.
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>
                    But for me, it’s not all about code. I also believe in using my skills to give back and make a positive impact. Through various volunteering roles, I’ve had the opportunity to work with underprivileged children, helping them with computer literacy and mathematics, and educating others about gender equality. These experiences have shaped my approach to technology, reminding me that it’s not just about making things work—it’s about making a real difference in people’s lives.
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>
                    When I’m not coding or brainstorming my next project, you’ll likely find me playing the keyboard or exploring new ways to learn and grow. I’m always eager to connect with like-minded individuals who share my passion for tech and innovation. If you have a project in mind or simply want to chat about tech, don’t hesitate to reach out. Let’s create something impactful together!
