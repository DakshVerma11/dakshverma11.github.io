        <h2>SafeDrive - Arduino Based GPS Tracker with Accident Detection and Driver Attention Detection</h2>
        <p><strong>Duration:</strong> Apr 2024 - Apr 2024</p>
        <p><strong>Associated with:</strong> National Institute of Technology Delhi</p>
        <p><strong>Description:</strong> SafeDrive is an Arduino-based advanced driver assistance system designed to enhance road safety. It integrates GPS tracking to provide real-time vehicle location, accelerometer-based driver attention monitoring to detect inattentiveness, and automatic emergency notification capabilities. The system aims to ensure prompt assistance in the event of a road accident, especially in remote locations or adverse weather conditions where response times may be delayed. In case of a crash, it sends an SMS with the vehicle's GPS coordinates and a pre-programmed emergency message to selected contacts.</p>
        <p><strong>Skills:</strong> Internet of Things (IoT), Arduino, Microcontrollers, Project Management, Circuit Design, Creativity and Innovation</p>
