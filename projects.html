                <h3>SafeDrive - Arduino Based GPS Tracker with Accident Detection and Driver Attention Detection</h3>
                <p><strong>Duration:</strong> Apr 2024 - Apr 2024</p>
                <p><strong>Associated with:</strong> National Institute of Technology Delhi</p>
                <p class="details">
                    SafeDrive is an Arduino-based advanced driver assistance system designed to enhance road safety. It integrates GPS tracking to provide real-time vehicle location, accelerometer-based driver attention monitoring to detect inattentiveness, and automatic emergency notification capabilities. The system aims to ensure prompt assistance in the event of a road accident, especially in remote locations or adverse weather conditions where response times may be delayed. In case of a crash, it sends an SMS with the vehicle's GPS coordinates and a pre-programmed emergency message to selected contacts.

                <h3>Racing FPV Drone Development for Technoxian World Robotics Championship</h3>
                <p><strong>Duration:</strong> May 2024 - Aug 2024</p>
                <p><strong>Associated with:</strong> VCR Laboratory, National Institute of Technology Delhi</p>
                <p class="details">
                    The Racing FPV Drone was developed as part of the Technoxian World Robotics Championship, where I worked under the VCR Laboratory team and received partial funding from NIT Delhi. The project aimed to create a high-performance racing drone for FPV (First Person View) racing, with an emphasis on speed, agility, and precision. Throughout the development, we focused on fine-tuning the drone’s hardware and software, ensuring that every component—from the flight controller to the FPV camera—was optimized for racing conditions. Although the project was a valuable learning experience, the drone was unfortunately destroyed due to a defective battery, highlighting the importance of quality control and testing in drone development. Despite this setback, the project provided hands-on experience with drone aerodynamics, embedded systems, and racing technologies.
